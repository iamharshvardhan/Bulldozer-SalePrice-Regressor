The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model/estimator that can forecast the selling price of bulldozers using factors such as their production date, dimensions, model, and other relevant attributes.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

### Instructions
* Clone the repository.
`git clone https://github.com/iamharshvardhan/Bulldozer-SalePrice-Regressor.git`
* Open the `end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine-learning model.

### Results
The machine learning model (`RandomForestRegressor`) achieves the score of "0.45174586332956956" on `Root_Mean_Square_Log_Error` metric.
